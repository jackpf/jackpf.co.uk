								 It started out as a little project to learn how to program, but developed into...this.

								 Jackpf.co.uk is in the process of cost reduction. I no longer feel it's beneficial to spend this much on hosting services. For this reason, my game servers and vent server will cease to run in the near future. However, all is not lost! I'm switching web hosting to a free host based in the US. I also still have a free mumble server (details below).
